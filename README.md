# App Development

Welcome to the exciting world of app development! In today's fast-paced digital age, mobile applications have become an integral part of our lives, transforming the way we communicate, work, and engage with the world around us. If you've ever wondered how these innovative and user-friendly apps are created, then you've come to the right place.

Discover the foundations of app development in this summer. From UI design to front-end and back-end development, learn to create and deploy your own mobile applications.

If you are new to this world, you might be wondering what's **Front-end and Back-end?**

*Front-end development* - Front-end app development focuses on building the visual and interactive components of an application that users directly interact with. By mastering front-end development, you will have the power to bring ideas to life and create seamless experiences that captivate users. For this we will be using **Google's Flutter SDK** which is used for crafting beautiful applications using a single codebase.

*Back-end development* - Back-end app development involves building the server-side components and functionalities that power an application. While front-end development focuses on the user interface and user experience, the back end deals with the behind-the-scenes operations, such as handling data, processing requests, and communicating with databases and external APIs.

*UI Design* - We'll design the user interface (UI) – the visual elements users interact with –  using **Figma**. This UI will guide users through the app's functionalities (built by the backend) in a clear, intuitive, and visually appealing way.

## Frameworks
There are two types of mobile applications: *Native* and *Hybrid*. Native applications are OS specific/system dependent. In simple words, in native applications the code written for Android can't run for IOS. You have to write two different codebases for both OS for the same application. For native applications (like Amazon), the code is written in Kotlin for android and Swift for IOS.

On the other hand, Hybrid applications, as its name suggests has same codebase for all OS. These are crossplatform applications. The most popular frameworks used for hybrid application development are Flutter by Google and React Native by Meta.

Now you may ask, Why **Flutter**?

Compared to its counterparts like React Native, Flutter is much easier to learn and use. Flutter supports a fast app development process and hence, it saves a lot of time that goes into making a smoothly functioning application. Flutter is relatively a newer framework compared to React Native but there is an increasing demand of Flutter for App Development.

**Pre-Requisites:** A working computer onto which you can install Flutter. Apart from that, we just need loads and loads of enthusiasm from your side.
